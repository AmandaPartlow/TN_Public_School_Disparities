### WIP: TN Public School Disparities  

**Executive Summary**  

This project is intended to look at the differences in quality among Tennessee public schools in different neighborhoods. The project will touch on issues such as race, socioeconomic status, and gerrymandering. There is a lot of data already out there which is great from data collection standpoint, but will also provide a challenge in trying to come up with answers that have not already been found. My end goal is to attempt to figure out how aggressive the issue is, why it is happening, and what solutions policy-makers could attempt.  

**Motivation**  

I have been working in public schools for the past decade and have seen firsthand the extreme disparity among schools in different areas of town. I know this is something people are generally aware of, but having been in the past only able to observe and unable to help, I would like to use this opportunity to take a look at what the data is saying.
